# Data Structure
This app was built behind the idea of the data structure STACK.
A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. A real-life example is a stack of books: you can only take a book from the top of the stack, and you can only add a book to the top of the stack. If you want to reach a book that is not on the top of the stack, you need to remove all of the books that are above that one. In the same way, in a stack data structure, you can only access the element on the top of the stack. The element that was added last will be the one to be removed first. Therefore, to implement a stack, you need to maintain a pointer to the top of the stack (the last element to be added).
